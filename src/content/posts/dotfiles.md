# My Dotfiles

I have two main repos when it comes to configs for my terminal and CLI tools. The first one, my main dotfiles repo, contains configs for my terminal of choice (ghostty), tmux, and my old kitty terminal config. 
The other repo, nvim-config, holds my Neovim config, written from scratch for the lazy.nvim plugin manager.

The dotfiles repo can be installed by cloning it and using `stow .` to symlink all my config files to the correct locations.
