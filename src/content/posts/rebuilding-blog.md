I got tired of having to conform to the restrictions of the [template](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari)
I was previously using for my blog, so I decided to rebuild it from scratch with [astro](https://astro.build).

Astro is a framework for building content-focused sites, such as blogs. 
I used the minimal blog template on astro to get started, and I've customised the template to my liking.
I still need to add dark mode themeing, but overall I'm happy with the new blog.
