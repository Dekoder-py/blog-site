*"What? You don't use neovim anymore?"*

Okay so the title might have been a bit clickbait-y lol. I haven't switched... *yet*.

# Trying Zed

I'm going to be using Zed as my main editor for the rest of January, unless I decide I don't like it before that. I might still use neovim for quick edits or temp files, but for most of my projects I'll try to use Zed.

## But Why?

I don't really have a reason, I just feel like switching it up. Part of it is that I feel like I spend a bit too much time editing my nvim config compared to actually working on somthing :loll:
