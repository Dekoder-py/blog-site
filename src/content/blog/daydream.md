### Daydream - A Global Game Jam

[Daydream](https://daydream.hackclub.com) took place between September 27 and 28 this year, across more than 100 cities worldwide.
I attended [Daydream Auckland](https://daydream.hackclub.com/auckland), which was organised and run by Niko. Niko reached out to me, inviting me to sign up, after he fulfilled my [Summer of Making](/posts/summer-of-making/) order for the CMF Buds Pro 2.
Daydream Auckland ran for 12 hours on the 28th of September, from 8am to 8pm. During this time, my group, along with about 6 other groups, worked hard (while messing about) creating games that followed the theme `Sacrifices must be made`.

My group created [Virus Shooter](https://dekoder-py.itch.io/daydream-virus-shooter), a 2D platformer where you sacrifice your health to shoot your weapon. I had previous experience making games with Godot, but I learned some new things, such as how to make the health display, bullets, and how to collaborate with others using Git branches.
We also submitted our game to [Daydream Global](https://itch.io/jam/daydream-global), where it's competing against all the games made at other Daydream events around the world.
