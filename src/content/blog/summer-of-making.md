### The ~summer~ winter was ours for the making. Now it's over.

Check out a summary of what I did [here](https://summer.hackclub.com/wrapped/share/CapUCZe).

I joined Hack Club through the Summer of Making after GitHub sent an email to the student developer mailing list. Throughout the summer (winter here in New Zealand) I made a variety of projects, mostly in python. I made friends in Hack Club, hosted a pygame workshop, attended a ship showcase, and ordered a few items.

When Niko fufilled my order for the CMF Buds Pro 2, he also told me about [Daydream Auckland](https://daydream.hackclub.com/auckland), which he was running. 
I've done a blog post on that [here](/posts/daydream/), but without SoM (Summer of Making), I would never have known about Hack Club or had the opportunities I've had. 
It's sad to see SoM ending, but I'm grateful I got to participate!
